# Devices Control

## Important Notes
* Project created with create-react-app
* For predictable state management, Redux is used
* Styling is handled through SCSS
* No external visual component is installed
* Since create-react-app is flexible in which port the App runs, the App still runs in :3000

## Running the Project
* Just navigate to its directory and execute 'npm start'
